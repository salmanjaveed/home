# API Governance
This is the current outline for API governance, providing an overview of how APIs are moved forward.

- [**Documentation**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10394726/SzYUagbA?version=latest)
## Define
This is the first stop of the API life cycle, and is all about defining each API in a consistent way. Providing the foundation for what an API will become, and provide the artifacts needed to understand how well each API is doing, and where it is in its journey. Providing a common approach to using a variety of artifacts to define each APIs, well as dedicated spaces for collaborate around the evolution of artifacts, and apply then throughout the API life cycle to consistently push forward each API being delivered.

### Workspaces (Postman)
This is for designing the Postman workspace that is used for managing this API, allowing it to be stored in one or many workspaces, with different levels of access for developers, QA, and other stakeholders. Establishing a single space where all work will occur on this API, allowing all stakeholders to easily find everything about an API.

 - Single Workspace - Needs a description.
 - All Workspaces - Needs a description.
 - Create Workspace - Needs a description.

### Organizations (GItHub)

 - Organizations - Needs a description.
 - Organization - Needs a description.

### Repository (GitHub)

 - Add User Repository - Needs a description.
 - Add Org Repository - Needs a description.
 - Repository - Needs a description.
 - Repositories - Needs a description.

### APIs (Postman)
This is for managing APIs within this workspace, providing requests that can be used to work with the different vesions of each API, using the central truth of this API as part of other processes and integrations.

 - Single API - Needs a description.
 - Get all APIs - Needs a description.
 - Get All API Versions - Needs a description.
 - Get An API Version - Needs a description.
 - Get API Schema - Needs a description.

### Collections (Postman)
This area is for managing collections derived from the contract for the API being managed. Each API should have a consistent set of collection each with a specific name and purpose. Each API should have the following collection to help manage different aspects of the API life cycle.

- **Life Cycle** - The collection that guides This API along a designated path, ensuring that each stop along this APIs journey is in alignment with other Union Fashion APIs, ensuring APIs operate in a similar way across teh organization.
- **Working** - A working collection that is just used for working with the API and defining the surface area of the API in real time without potentially affecting documentation, mocks, tests, and other types of collections.
- **Documentation** - The documentation collection are design for publishing both API documentation as well as generate mock servers for each API, providing a consistent definition that can be used to make each API more tamgible without writing code.
- **Contract Testing** - A collection designated for contract testing on each API providing a set of tests that cover 100% of the API, ensuring that each API is meeting its obligations as defined by the APIs contract.
- **Performance** - Designating collections that are specifically for evaluating the performance of this API, checking the latency around the clock from different geographic regions, focusing on the quality of each API being delivered as part of Union FAshion.
- **Security** - Having a collection that only looks at the security of an API, ensuring that the entire surface area of each API is secure, and the practices in place across APIs are consistent with an organizational wide strategy.
- **Governance** - The final collection type which is focused on the overal consistency, quality, and scope of APIs being delivered across teams, helping ensure that Union Fashion APIs are deliver a seamless experience no matter who delivers each aPI.

We will be adding other collections to this list as they are developed. WE are anticipating needing integration testing and workflow collections, but are failry cnfident there will be other types of collections to emerge as our approach to delivering APIs mature.

### Environments (Postman)
This is the stop along the API life cycle that is focused on managing the environments for how an API is developed and delivered, as well as consumed and integrated. Providing one or more different contexts in which this API can be managed and used.

Right now the guidance is to have two separate environments for each of the stages of development of this API, providing a key / value store for the API during each of these stages:

- **Development** - A key value store for abstracting away everything that is need to develop an API in an API design first manner, storing keys, tokens, and other vital information that is needed to bring a new version of an API to life.
- **Production** - A key value store for abstracting away everything that is need to operate and sustain an API, storing keys, tokens, and other vital information that is needed to properly deliver each API to consumers publicly or privatley.

Eventually we made add a middle stage between development and production, but for now we'll just separate out development from production. After the stages of developerment, there are two other envrionments that should be present for each API:

- **Life Cycle** - This colleciton is designed to help move each API forward, providing the details needed all along the API life cycle, while harvesting and aggregating valuable details about what is going on with this API as it oves forward.
- **Governance** - This collection is about storing what is needed to govern this API, helping understand the overal definition and design of the API, but also every other stop along the API life cycle to quantify and understand what is happening.

Each API should have these four environments, providing an up to date snapshot of this API in these four states. Helping interact with the API while in development as well as in production, but also helping to push forward the API in a consistent way using API, and by having a coherent API governance strategy to ensure API behavior is consistent across the organizaiton.
